<h2 align="center">VUE JS WITH GRAPHQL</h2>
<br />
Here I am continuing working with to-do list app from "to-do-vuejs-mysql" repo, but instead of MySQL - I work with GraphQL. Here I am practicing doing following:

* Setting of GraphQL

* Working with GraphQL

* Get data in GraphQL

* Creating to-do task in GraphQL

* Cancelation of the to-do task in GraphQL

* Deleting to-do task in GraphQL

### Built with:
* [GRAPHQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [EXPRESS GRAPHQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql)

### Prerequisites:

For running this project you need NPM

* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo or download it into your local machine
```sh
https://github.com/vokhlachev/to-do-vuejs-graphql.git
```
3. Run NPM in into project folder to get all packages and dependencies from package.json
```sh
npm install 
```
4. Enjoy! :smile:
